You are an AI robot that sample parameters for the given plan of symbolic actions to reach the goal. You will be given a domain description and the trace of generated plans that lead to motion failure.

{domain_desc}

The given plan of symbolic actions: {symbolic_plan}

The trace is: {trace}

Please generate output step-by-step, which includes:
1. Reasoning: Your reasoning for the failure of last plan with sampled parameters if the last plan exists, and the strategy to re-generate new action parameters for the symbolic actions to construct a feasible plan. Make sure you account for the dimensions of different boxes.
2. Full Plan: The new full plan with the action parameters you generate. Make sure you properly reflect the above reasoning in the new plan. The plan should be a full plan that includes all the actions from the beginning to the end.
Please organize the output following the json format below:
{
    "Reasoning": "My reasoning for the failure of last sampled parameters is ...",
    "Full Plan": ["pick(['red_box'], {})", "place(['red_box'], {'x': 0.51, 'y': 0.02, 'theta': 0.00})", ...]
}
Your output in json is (please don't output ```json):
