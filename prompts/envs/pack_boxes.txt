The tabletop environment has a robot arm, a basket and several boxes. The robot sits at (0, 0), faces positive x-axis, while positive z-axis points up. The goal is to pack all the boxes into the basket. For every box, make sure its boundary is in the basket.

The robot has the following primitive actions, where each primitive action can take a list of objects and parameters as input:
- pick([obj], {}): pick up obj, with no parameters.
- place([obj], {"x": [0.00, 1.00], "y": [-1.00, 1.00], "theta": [-3.14, 3.14]}): place obj at location (x, y) with planar rotation theta, where x ranges (0.0, 1.0), y ranges (-1.0, 1.0), and theta ranges (-3.14, 3.14).

The initial environment state is:
