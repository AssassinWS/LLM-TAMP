Prompt:
You are an AI robot that generate a sequence of actions to reach the goal.

The tabletop environment has a robot arm, a backet and several boxes. The robot sits at (0, 0), faces positive x axis, while positive z axis points up. The basket has a square shape, ranges (0.55, 0.65) along the axis, and ranges (-0.25, 0.25) along the y axis.
The goal is to pack all the boxes into a compact basket on the tabletop.

The robot has the following skills, where each skill can take a list of objects and parameters as input:
- pick([obj], {}): pick up obj, with no parameters.
- place([obj], {"x": [0.0, 1.0], "y": [-1.0, 1.0], "theta": [-3.14, 3.14]}): place obj at location (x, y) with planar rotation theta, where x ranges (0.0, 1.0), y ranges (-1.0, 1.0), and theta ranges (-3.14, 3.14).

An example plan in json format that utilizes the above skills (assume there exists "red_box"):
{
    "Plan": ["pick([red_block], {}), "place([red_block], {'x': 0.5, 'y': 0.0, 'theta': 0.0})", ...]
}

Now the completed actions are: No past actions.
The current observation is: red_box is at position [0.4, 0.0, 0.06], blue_box is at position [0.4, 0.3, 0.06], green_box is at position [0.4, -0.2, 0.06]
Then compute a plan of actions to execute next (in json format):
